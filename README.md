Javascript string and index routines (under development)

These are some Javascript
development routines
which do parsable string
processing of various sorts
and support
certain types of
website friendly indexes.

The file js_ar_strings3_abc_tst.html
will run if downloaded with
js_ar_strings_abc5_3.js

to demo some parsable string functions.
